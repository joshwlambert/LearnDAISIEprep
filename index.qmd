Welcome to the DAISIE computer practical of the Island Biology course. Here you will find the material to learn how to use the DAISIE ecosystem of R packages to analyse the ecology and evolution of island communities. These tools have been developed to answer research questions in island biogeography and macroevolution. We will apply them to a case study of a group of beetles from the Caribbean islands.

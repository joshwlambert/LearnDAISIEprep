We will then use these estimated rates to simulate how the number of species has changed through time in this taxonomic group. The practical will use mainly the R packages DAISIE and DAISIEprep. We will learn how to interpret and prepare data for analyses using DAISIE, how to fit DAISIE models to phylogenetic data, and how to simulate phylogenies of island communities.\n\n![](images/beetle4-01.png){width=\"66\"}![](images/beetle1-01.png){width=\"147\"}![](images/beetle3-01.png){width=\"57\"}![](images/beetle2-01.png){width=\"70\"}\n\n![Beetles (Phylopic); Caribbean Islands (Google Earth)](images/Caribbean_Google_Earth.png)\n\nThe practical is divided into 4 main parts (please follow them in this order):\n\n1.  Read the instruction of the graded assignment.\n\n2.  [Learn how to use DAISIEprep](#sec-1.-daisieprep) to prepare and extract data (1-2 hours). DAISIEprep is an R package that allows users to format phylogenetic data for subsequent analyses in DAISIE.\n\n3.  [Learn how to use DAISIE](#sec-2.-daisie) to estimate parameters and simulate islands (1-2 hours). DAISIE is an R package that allows fitting island biogeography models and simulating islands.\n\n4.  [Apply the above approaches to a dataset of beetles from the Caribbean](#sec-insula). Writing up this part is the graded assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\nAfter you have finished the DAISIEprep and DAISIE practicals, you can begin applying these techniques to the *Insula* dataset.\n\n**The aim is to be able to answer the following questions:**\n\nA.  How many times has *Insula* colonised the Caribbean islands?\nB.  How many times has *Insula* colonised Jamaica?\nC.  How many radiations have occured on Jamaica?\nD.  What are the rates of colonisation, speciation and extinction for *Insula* in Jamaica?\nE.  Is there evidence for diversity-dependence in the *Insula* species of Jamaica?\nF.  Is there evidence for equilibrium dynamics on the island of Jamaica?\nG.  How has the diversity of *Insula* on Jamaica changed through time (according to DAISIE simulations)?\n\n\\\n\nIn sum, you need to load the phylogeny into R, use DAISIEprep to extract the DAISIE datalist. Then, fit DAISIE to that datalist to estimate parameters (extinction, colonisation, speciation, carrying capacity, and simulate islands), and to simulate islands. Make use of the DAISIEprep and DAISIE tutorials as well as the *Insula* tree, tables and figures provided. With these analyses you will be able to answer all the [questions](#sec-4.-questions).\n\nIn the practical folder you will find all the relevant data:\n\n-   [Insula.tre](data/Insula.tre) the phylogenetic tree of *Insula* (to be loaded into R for analyses, but also visualized using Figtree): note that the species have numbers instead of latin names (Spec 1, Spec 2, etc).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](insula_tutorial_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   [Insula_checklist.xlsx](data/Insula_checklist.xlsx): A species checklist including the distribution, endemicity status as well as the species that are missing from the phylogeny but which should be considered in the DAISIE analyses.\n\n-   [Figure_Insula_Tip_states.pdf](data/Figure_Insula_Tip_states.pdf): A figure of the phylogeny with the tips coloured by the island where the species occurs.\n\n![Phylogeny showing the geographical distribution of the extant species](images/Figure_Insula_tip_states.png)\n\n-   [Figure_Insula_ancestral_state_reconstruction.pdf](data/Figure_Insula_ancestral_state_reconstruction.pdf): A figure of an ancestral range reconstruction for the genus.\n\n![Ancestral area reconstruction](images/Figure_Insula_ancestral_state_reconstruction.png)\n\n**Tips**:\n\nFor the DAISIE analyses use:\n\n[Island age:]{.underline} 40 million years\n\n[Mainland pool size]{.underline}: 100 species\n\nDon't forget to add the missing species.\n\n**After the practical, a file with an example of how to run the *Insula* analyses will be provided, which can be used as a guideline in case you had difficulties completing the practical.**\n",

We will then use these estimated rates to simulate how the number of species has changed through time in this taxonomic group. The practical will use mainly the R packages DAISIE and DAISIEprep. We will learn how to interpret and prepare data for analyses using DAISIE, how to fit DAISIE models to phylogenetic data, and how to simulate phylogenies of island communities.\n\nThe practical is divided into 3 main parts:\n\n1.  [Learn how to use DAISIEprep](#sec-1.-daisieprep) to prepare and extract data (1-2 hours). DAISIEprep is an R package that allows users to format phylogenetic data for subsequent analyses in DAISIE.\n\n2.  [Learn how to use DAISIE](#sec-2.-daisie) to estimate parameters and simulate islands (1-2 hours). DAISIE is an R package that allows fitting island biogeography models and simulating islands.\n\n3.  [Apply the above approaches to a dataset of beetles from the Caribbean](#sec-insula). Writing up this part is the graded assignment.\n\n**Before you start with the DAISIEprep and DAISIE tutorials, please read the introduction to the graded assignment below.**\n\n# Before you begin:\n\n## Install Software required:\n\n-   Install: [FigTree](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases)\n\n-   Install [R](https://www.r-project.org)\n\n-   Install [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)\n\n-   Open the program RStudio. Open the file [0_Install_packages](0.Install_packages.html) and run that code in Rstudio. This should install all required R packages (**may take a while!**).\n\n## Tutorial files\n\nYou will need to follow the instructions of the tutorials, available in HTML format, which you can open on a browser\n\n## 1. DAISIEprep {#sec-1.-daisieprep}\n\n[DAISIEprep tutorial](2.DAISIEprep.html)\n\n## 2. DAISIE {#sec-2.-daisie}\n\n[DAISIE tutorial](3.DAISIE.html)\n\n#### After you have finished the DAISIEprep and DAISIE practicals, you can begin applying these techniques to the *Insula* dataset.\n\n## 3. *Insula* assignment {#sec-insula}\n\nThe beetle genus *Insula* (imaginary genus, does not exist in reality), is a large genus of beetles of approximately 50 species, distributed in Central America and the Caribbean islands. The majority of the species in the genus are endemic to islands, and it is thought to be a great example of colonisation and diversification on islands. The species of the genus occur in forests, shrublands or freshwater habitats. They are good swimmers but cannot survive in sea water.\n\nOne of the most diverse islands for the genus *Insula* is Jamaica, a large Caribbean island with a complex geological history. It is thought that Jamaica has a continental origin, but has been isolated from other landmasses for approximately 40 million years. The mainland pool of closely related species of beetles in the continent (i.e. species that could have colonised the islands) has been estimated to be approximately 100 species. More than 15 species of *Insula* are thought to be endemic to Jamaica, with a few species being only recently described or discovered. However, the evolutionary island biogeography of *Insula* on Jamaica remains unknown.\n\nA very well-sampled time-calibrated phylogeny for the genus has recently been published, covering all the island where *Insula* occurs. A few species have been recently discovered and were not sampled in the phylogeny. There is no evidence of recently extinct species. The authors of the study performed an ancestral range reconstruction, so it is possible to infer the ancestral areas and number of colonisation events.\n\nMaking use of the knowledge you gathered from DAISIEprep and DAISIE, in combination with the phylogenetic tree and the species checklist provided, you can extract data for the island of Jamaica and fit DAISIE to the data.\n\n#### The aim is to be able to answer the following questions: {#sec-4.-questions}\n\nA. How many times has *Insula* colonised the Caribbean islands?\n\nB. How many times has *Insula* colonised Jamaica?\n\nC. How many radiations have occured on Jamaica?\n\nD. What are the rates of colonisation, speciation and extinction for *Insula* in Jamaica?\n\nE. Is there evidence for diversity-dependence in the *Insula* species of Jamaica?\n\nF. Is there evidence for equilibrium dynamics on the island of Jamaica?\n\nG. How has the diversity of *Insula* on Jamaica changed through time (according to DAISIE simulations)?\n\n**Written assignment:**\n\n-   **Follow the self-guided tutorials of the computer practical and run analyses using DAISIE to answer all of the above questions in an individually written report.**\n\n-   **In your report, briefly describe the methodology used for the analyses of Insula, your main results, and limitations of the analyses.**\n\n-   **Format: .doc and .pdf, 2-3 pages, Calibri font (or similar), minimum font size 10.**\n\n-   **Include any tables and figures that you think could be relevant (be creative!), as long as they are well explained (including legends) and keep within the 2-3 page limit.**\n\n-   **Do not include code in the assignment (unless you want to point out something specific with the script).**\n\n-   **Focus on the interpretation of the results from a biological perspective.**\n\nIn sum, you need to load the phylogeny into R, use DAISIEprep to extract the DAISIE datalist. Then, fit DAISIE to that datalist to estimate parameters (extinction, colonisation, speciation, carrying capacity, and simulate islands), and to simulate islands. Make use of the DAISIEprep and DAISIE tutorials as well as the *Insula* tree, tables and figures provided. With these analyses you will be able to answer all the [questions](#sec-4.-questions).\n\n### In the practical folder you will find all the relevant data:\n\n-   [Insula.tre](data/Insula.tre) the phylogenetic tree of *Insula* (to be loaded into R for analyses, but also visualized using Figtree): note that the species have numbers instead of latin names (Spec 1, Spec 2, etc).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ape)\nInsula_tree<-read.nexus(\"data/Insula.tre\")\nplot(Insula_tree)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](insula_tutorial_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   [Insula_checklist.xlsx](data/Insula_checklist.xlsx): A species checklist including the distribution, endemicity status as well as the species that are missing from the phylogeny but which should be considered in the DAISIE analyses.\n\n-   [Figure_Insula_Tip_states.pdf](data/Figure_Insula_Tip_states.pdf): A figure of the phylogeny with the tips coloured by the island where the species occurs.\n\n![Phylogeny showing the geographical distribution of the extant species](images/Figure_Insula_tip_states.png)\n\n-   [Figure_Insula_ancestral_state_reconstruction.pdf](data/Figure_Insula_ancestral_state_reconstruction.pdf): A figure of an ancestral range reconstruction for the genus.\n\n![Ancestral area reconstruction](images/Figure_Insula_ancestral_state_reconstruction.png)\n\n**Tips**:\n\nFor the DAISIE analyses use:\n\n[Island age:]{.underline} 40 million years\n\n[Mainland pool size]{.underline}: 100 species\n\nDon't forget to add the missing species.\n\n**After the practical, a file with an example of how to run the *Insula* analyses will be provided, which can be used as a guideline in case you had difficulties completing the practical.**\n",
